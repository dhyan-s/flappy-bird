# Flappy Bird
#### **This is my fresh take on the classic Flappy Bird game that I built a few years ago. This project focuses on enhancing the code structure and organization to make it cleaner and easier to work with.**

### Setup
Please install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already and follow the below steps:
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/dhyan-s/flappy-bird-redesign`, assuming you have Git installed. If not, simply download the code from here and extract the zip file.
2. **Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Game**: Execute `python flappy_bird.py` in the project root to run the game.
4. **Gameplay**: Use the spacebar or mouse click to control the bird's flight. The objective is to navigate the bird through the openings between the pipes without colliding. Each successful passage earns you a point. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
5. **Enjoy and Contribute**: Play the game, explore the codebase, and feel free to contribute to the project by following the guidelines outlined in the "Contributing" section.

Explore the code, have fun playing the game, and feel free to contribute if you'd like to help make it better. I'm still learning and would love to hear your suggestions.

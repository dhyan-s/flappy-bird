### Setup
Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already and follow the below steps:
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone "<repository-url>"`, assuming you have Git installed. If not, simply download the code from here and extract the zip file.
2. **Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Game**: Execute `python flappy_bird.py` in the project root to run the game.
4. **Gameplay**: Use the spacebar or mouse click to control the bird's flight. The objective is to navigate the bird through the openings between the pipes without colliding. Each successful passage earns you a point. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
5. **Enjoy and Contribute**: Play the game, explore the codebase, and feel free to contribute to the project.
